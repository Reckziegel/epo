Consequently, method stabilizes MVO adjusting downward Sharpe-Ratios least important components. elegance EPO approach lies connection three major optimization methods: MVO, Bayesian Optimization, Robust Optimization. incorporating closed-form solution single shrinkage parameter, denoted w ∈ {0, 1}, investor can seamlessly navigate optimization process. w = 0, EPO solution coincides classical MVO. Conversely, setting w = 1 disregards correlations, resulting portfolio similar non-optimized 1/N allocation. real-world applications, crucial consider potential deviation reference point benchmark. EPO effectively handles concern “Anchored EPO” approach. w = 0, aligns classical MVO, w = 1 precisely matches benchmark. intriguing outcomes arise 0 < w < 1, leading portfolios resembling Black-Litterman model. , shrinking parameter, w, tunes confidence prior, offering flexible dynamic optimization process. important note unlike Black-Litterman, “Anchored EPO” restrict reference point “Market Portfolio,” making general widely applicable. Overall, Enhanced Portfolio Optimization (EPO) method presents novel, efficient, adaptable framework portfolio optimization. ability address limitations traditional methods incorporating various optimization approaches single preference parameter makes powerful tool investors seeking stable well-tailored portfolios.","code":""},{"path":"https://reckziegel.github.io/epo/index.html","id":"installation","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Installation","title":"Enhanced Portfolio Optimization (EPO)","text":"Install official version CRAN : Install development version github :","code":"install.packages(\"epo\") # install.packages(\"devtools\") devtools::install_github(\"Reckziegel/epo\")"},{"path":"https://reckziegel.github.io/epo/index.html","id":"example","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Example","title":"Enhanced Portfolio Optimization (EPO)","text":"","code":"library(epo)  x <- diff(log(EuStockMarkets)) # stock returns s <- colMeans(x) # it could be any signal   ################## ### The Simple EPO ##################  # Traditional Mean-Variance Analysis epo(x = x, signal = s, method = \"simple\", w = 0) #> [1]  0.1914569  0.9894828 -0.3681779  0.1872382  # 100% Shrinkage epo(x = x, signal = s, method = \"simple\", w = 1) #> [1] 0.2352863 0.3659986 0.1375249 0.2611902  # 50% Classical MVO and 50% Shrinkage epo(x = x, signal = s, method = \"simple\", w = 0.5) #> [1]  0.223281853  0.564005906 -0.009868083  0.222580324  #################### ### The Anchored EPO  ####################  benchmark <- rep(0.25, 4) # 1/N Portfolio  # Traditional Mean-Variance Analysis epo(x = x, signal = s, method = \"anchored\", w = 0.0, anchor = benchmark) #> [1]  0.1914569  0.9894828 -0.3681779  0.1872382  # 100% on the Anchor portfolio epo(x = x, signal = s, method = \"anchored\", w = 1.0, anchor = benchmark) #> [1] 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25  # 50% on Mean-Variance Analysis and 50% on the Anchor Portfolio epo(x = x, signal = s, method = \"anchored\", w = 0.5, anchor = benchmark) #> [1] 0.2374674 0.4557503 0.1004711 0.2063111"},{"path":"https://reckziegel.github.io/epo/index.html","id":"references","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"References","title":"Enhanced Portfolio Optimization (EPO)","text":"Pedersen, Lasse Heje Babu, Abhilash Levine, Ari, Enhanced Portfolio Optimization (January 2, 2020).
